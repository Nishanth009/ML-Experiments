# ML-Experiments

Implementation of **Logistic regression, Perceptron and Neural networks**(MSE as loss) from scratch

Objective of this work is to understand how these machine learning algorithms work in the most simplest way possible.The code is not optimised for performace but made it easy to understand

## Instructions
Install Anaconda then run,

python script_name (ex:Logistic.py)
